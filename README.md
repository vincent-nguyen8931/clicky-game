Features
------------------

The application utilizes the MVC architecture. This allows for nice organization of the files by their purpose. There is also continuous calculations of all the exercises performed throughout the workout to keep the user up to date with what they have done. 

Lessons learned
---------------------
The biggest struggle with this application has been to find the proper routes to create in order to link with the existing frontend files. I believe I had gotten the routes correct and functional however no data is being passed from the frontend to the backend, specifically to the file workout.js in the public folder. This hiccup has taken a significant time to debug and no resolution has been reached.

There is a task to have another field created dynamically that adds the total length of workout time based on every exercise done. This test could not be performed due to the above task being unsolved.

These combined errors have also made it so that the application on Heroku will not load. I imagine that once these issues have a solution along with no other errors coming up, the app will run with mongoDB on Heroku.
